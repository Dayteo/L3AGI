This guide provides instructions for integrating the Bittensor wallet into your Polkadot extension.

## Installation

1. Install the Polkadot extension from [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) on Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

## Account Setup

2. After installation, you can either create a new account or import your existing one. By default, the Bittensor network is not available in the network options, so leave it unchanged for now.

## Network Configuration

3. To configure your account for the Bittensor network:

   - Navigate to [Polkadot Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) and authorize the application if prompted. Polkadot will be the default network selected.

   - Open the networks tab and navigate to "Live Networks."

   - Select Bittensor from the list of available networks.

   - Proceed to Settings => Metadata and press "Update Metadata."

   - Your account network can now be changed to Bittensor from the Polkadot extension.`
